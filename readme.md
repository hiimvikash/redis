Distributed caching.

## What if redis server goes down and in memory data is lost ?
- It's completely okay even if your redis data is lost, because at the end of the day it was just a cacheed data, your PRIMARY DB has all your data, which can be eaily cached on further upcoming requests when redis will be up and running again.
## Understanding In-Memory Data Structure Store

Think of an in-memory data structure store as a super-fast database that stores data in your system’s RAM instead of on disk. Since RAM is much faster than traditional storage (like an SSD or hard drive), retrieving and updating data happens almost instantly.

However, just because it works in memory doesn’t mean the data is lost when the system restarts. To prevent data loss, Redis (a popular in-memory database) provides two ways to save data:

### 1️⃣ RDB (Redis Database File) - Snapshot Backup
RDB takes a snapshot (a full copy) of all the data at specific time intervals. This is like taking a backup photo of your entire database at regular times.

#### 📌 Example RDB settings:
```bash
save 900 1       # Save every 900 seconds (15 min) if at least 1 key changed  
save 300 10      # Save every 300 seconds (5 min) if at least 10 keys changed  
save 60 10000    # Save every 60 seconds (1 min) if at least 10,000 keys changed  
```

- 🔹 The more often Redis saves, the less data you lose in case of a crash.
- 🔹 But frequent saving can slow performance slightly because it takes a full snapshot each time.

### 2️⃣ AOF (Append Only File) - Write Log Backup
AOF works differently. Instead of taking a full snapshot, it logs every write operation (like adding, updating, or deleting data) one by one.

#### 📌 How it works:
- Every time data changes, Redis adds (or appends) that change to a file.
- If the server crashes, Redis can replay this file to restore all operations step by step.

- 🔹 AOF keeps more recent changes compared to RDB.
- 🔹 But the file can grow large over time because every single action is recorded.

### Which one should you use?
✅ **RDB** is better if you want less disk usage and periodic backups (faster recovery but might lose recent changes).
✅ **AOF** is better if you want every single change saved (more reliable but uses more disk space).
✅ Many systems use **both RDB and AOF together** for a balance of speed and safety.



# 2. Installation of Redis.
- `docker run -d --name redis-stack -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest`
- Here we are running our redis in docker.
- PORT `6379` is where our actual redis server is running.
- PORT `8001` is where our redis GUI is running.

# 3. Interaction with redis-cli.
- run `docker exec -it 3af54f82e390 redis-cli` to switch to redis-cli.
- to test run `PING` you will get `PONG`.
- Now you're connected with your redis server.

# 4. Redis Strings.
## 1️⃣ What are Redis Strings?
Redis strings store sequences of bytes (text, serialized objects, binary arrays, images, etc.).
They are the simplest value type in Redis and are often used for caching.
Keys in Redis are also strings, so using string values means mapping one string to another.
### What can be stored in Redis Strings?
- ✔ Text ("hello world")
- ✔ Numbers ("100", "3.14")
- ✔ Serialized Objects (JSON, XML, etc.) : `JSON.stringify()` converts a JavaScript object into a string representation.
- ✔ Binary Data (Images, audio, videos, etc.)
## 2️⃣ Basic Redis Commands for Strings
### 🔹 SET & GET – Storing and Retrieving Values

```redis
SET key value
GET key
```
✔ Example:
```redis
SET bike:1 Deimos
GET bike:1
```
📌 Explanation:

- SET assigns a value (Deimos) to a key (bike:1).
- GET retrieves the value associated with the key.
- **⚠️Important:** If the key already exists, SET will replace the existing value.

### 🔹 SET with NX and XX Options
```redis
SET key value NX   # Set only if key does NOT exist
SET key value XX   # Set only if key ALREADY exists
```
✔ Example:
```redis
SET bike:1 "bike" NX  # Won't set if bike:1 already exists
SET bike:1 "bike" XX  # Will only set if bike:1 exists
```
📌 Explanation:

- NX (No eXist) ensures the key is only set if it doesn’t exist.
- XX (eXist) ensures the key is only set if it already exists.
### 🔹 MSET & MGET – Setting and Retrieving Multiple Keys at Once
```redis
MSET key1 value1 key2 value2 key3 value3
MGET key1 key2 key3
```
✔ Example:
```redis
MSET bike:1 "Deimos" bike:2 "Ares" bike:3 "Vanth"
MGET bike:1 bike:2 bike:3
```
📌 Explanation:

- MSET allows setting multiple key-value pairs in one command.
- MGET retrieves multiple values at once, reducing latency.
## 3️⃣ Strings as Counters (Atomic Operations)
### 🔹INCR & INCRBY – Incrementing Counters

```redis
INCR key          # Increments value by 1
INCRBY key N      # Increments value by N
```
✔ Example:

```redis
SET total_crashes 0
INCR total_crashes    # 1
INCRBY total_crashes 10  # 11
```
📌 Explanation:

- INCR converts the string into an integer and increases it.
- INCRBY allows incrementing by any number.
- This operation is atomic, meaning multiple clients won't cause race conditions.
### 🔹 DECR & DECRBY – Decrementing Counters
```redis
DECR key          # Decrements value by 1
DECRBY key N      # Decrements value by N
```
✔ Example:
```redis
DECR stock_count
DECRBY stock_count 5
```
📌 Explanation:
- Works similar to INCR, but decreases values.
## 4️⃣ Advanced String Commands
🔹 GETSET – Updating a Value While Retrieving the Old One
```redis
GETSET key new_value
```
✔ Example:
```redis
SET visitor_count 100
GETSET visitor_count 0   # Returns 100 and sets visitor_count to 0
```
- Useful for resetting counters while capturing the old value.
## 5️⃣ Limits and Performance Considerations
- ✔ Maximum string size: 512 MB
- ✔ Most string operations are O(1) (constant time), making them fast.
- ✔ Be careful with random-access commands like SUBSTR, GETRANGE, SETRANGE, as they can be O(n) and cause performance issues with large strings.
## NodeJs perspective for same.
- Connect the client @ `./client.js`

```js
const {Redis} = require('ioredis');
const client = new Redis(6379); // if no port specified then it connects to 6379

// OR THIS :-
const client = new Redis({
  host: process.env.REDIS_HOST || '127.0.0.1',
  port: process.env.REDIS_PORT || 6379,
});

module.exports = {client}
```
- Use the client for specific operation.

```js
const client = require('./client');

const res1 = await client.set("bike:1", "Deimos");
console.log(res1);  // OK
const res2 = await client.get("bike:1");
console.log(res2);  // Deimos
```

- You can also expire the key in particular time period.
```js
await client.expire("bike:1", 10) // expire this particular key in 10s.
```

# 5. Redis List
- [if stuck go here](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/lists/)

## Introduction to Redis Lists

Redis lists are **linked lists** of string values. They are commonly used for:

- Implementing **stacks** and **queues**.
- Building **queue management** for background worker systems.

---

## **Basic Commands**

### **1. LPUSH & RPUSH** (Add elements to a list)
- `LPUSH` adds an element to the **head** (left) of a list.
- `RPUSH` adds an element to the **tail** (right) of a list.

#### Example:
```redis
LPUSH mylist "A"
RPUSH mylist "B"
LRANGE mylist 0 -1
```
**Output:** `["A", "B"]`

```redis
LPUSH mylist "X"
RPUSH mylist "Y"
LRANGE mylist 0 -1
```
**Output:** `["X", "A", "B", "Y"]`

---

### **2. LPOP & RPOP** (Remove elements from a list)
- `LPOP` removes and returns an element from the **head**.
- `RPOP` removes and returns an element from the **tail**.

#### Example:
```redis
LPUSH mylist "A" "B" "C"
LPOP mylist
```
**Output:** `"C"`

```redis
RPUSH mylist "X" "Y" "Z"
RPOP mylist
```
**Output:** `"Z"`

---

### **3. LLEN** (Get the length of a list)
- `LLEN` returns the number of elements in a list.

#### Example:
```redis
RPUSH mylist "A" "B" "C"
LLEN mylist
```
**Output:** `3`

```redis
LPUSH newlist "X" "Y"
LLEN newlist
```
**Output:** `2`

---

### **4. LMOVE** (Move elements between lists atomically)
- `LMOVE` moves elements from **one list to another**.
- It can move from **left to left** or **right to right**.

#### Example:
```redis
LPUSH source "A" "B"
LMOVE source destination LEFT LEFT
```
**Output:** Moves `"B"` from `source` to `destination`.

```redis
RPUSH source "X" "Y"
LMOVE source destination RIGHT RIGHT
```
**Output:** Moves `"Y"` from `source` to `destination`.

---

### **5. LRANGE** (Get a range of elements from a list)
- `LRANGE list start end` extracts a range of elements.
- Negative indexes can be used to count from the end.

#### Example:
```redis
RPUSH mylist "A" "B" "C" "D"
LRANGE mylist 1 2
```
**Output:** `["B", "C"]`

```redis
LRANGE mylist -2 -1
```
**Output:** `["C", "D"]`

---

### **6. LTRIM** (Trim a list to a specific range)
- `LTRIM` keeps only elements within a given range.

#### Example:
```redis
RPUSH mylist "A" "B" "C" "D"
LTRIM mylist 1 2
```
**Output:** `["B", "C"]`

```redis
RPUSH numbers "1" "2" "3" "4"
LTRIM numbers 0 1
```
**Output:** `["1", "2"]`

---

## **Blocking Commands**

### **7. BLPOP & BRPOP** (Blocking pop operations)
- `BLPOP` waits for an element to be available in a list, removing it from the **head** as soon as element is inserted within the provided time frame.
- `BRPOP` does the same from the **tail**.

#### Example:
```redis
BLPOP mylist 10
```
**Waits for 10 seconds** to pop an element from the head.

```redis
BRPOP mylist 5
```
**Waits for 5 seconds** to pop an element from the tail.

---

### **8. BLMOVE** (Blocking move operation)
- `BLMOVE` moves an element between lists, blocking if the source is empty.

#### Example:
```redis
BLMOVE source destination LEFT RIGHT 10
```
**Waits for 10 seconds** to move an element from `source` to `destination`.

```redis
BLMOVE queue processed RIGHT LEFT 5
```
**Waits for 5 seconds** to move an element from `queue` to `processed`.

---

## **How Redis Lists Work**

- **Implemented as linked lists**, ensuring constant-time insertions and deletions.
- **Fast for queue and stack operations** but slower for indexed access.
- **Efficient memory usage** when handling large lists.

---

## **First Steps with Redis Lists**

### **Pushing & Retrieving Elements**
```redis
RPUSH queue "task1" "task2"
LPUSH queue "urgent_task"
LRANGE queue 0 -1
```
**Output:** `["urgent_task", "task1", "task2"]`

---

### **Popping Elements**
```redis
LPOP queue
```
**Output:** `"urgent_task"`

```redis
RPOP queue
```
**Output:** `"task2"`

---

### **Moving Elements Between Lists**
```redis
LPUSH pending "taskA"
LMOVE pending processing LEFT LEFT
```
**Output:** Moves `"taskA"` from `pending` to `processing`.

---

### **Trimming a List**
```redis
RPUSH numbers "1" "2" "3" "4"
LTRIM numbers 0 2
```
**Output:** `["1", "2", "3"]`

---

## **Conclusion**
Redis Lists provide a **fast, flexible** way to manage ordered collections of elements. They are particularly useful for **queues, stacks, and messaging systems**. Mastering the key commands helps optimize **performance and memory usage** in Redis-based applications.

# 12. Implementation of redis in NodeJS

```js
.
.
.

app.get("/", async (req, res)=>{
    const cachedValue = await client.get("todos");
    if(cachedValue) return res.json(JSON.parse(cachedValue));

    const {data} = await axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos');

    await client.set("todos", JSON.stringify(data));
    await client.expire("todos", 30);

    return res.json(data);
})
```

# 13. BullMQ - Messaging Queue which uses redis.
- `connection.js` 
- Creating seperate `connection.js` file because if you write the connection code in `index.js or wroker.js` and think to import from their then it will cause them to run.
- let say IF you place your connection code in `worker.js` and import it in `index.js` then while running index.js(your goal was to just add task in queue, worker should starts when we run worker.js file) but here worker will start automatically because **we are importing from worker.js.**

```js
import Redis from "ioredis"

export const connection = new Redis("rediss://default:AVExAAIjcDFiYzk3MGQyNDZhNmI0MjE2YTY4ODhiNTFlYzM4MjAyZHAxMA@modern-puma-20785.upstash.io:6379", {maxRetriesPerRequest:null})
```
- `index.js` : Adding task in Queue
```js
import { Queue } from "bullmq";
import { connection } from "./connection.js";

const logQueue = new Queue("logQueue", {connection});

async function init(){
    for(let i=67; i<71; i++){
        console.log(`Adding logger ID : ${i} into QUEUE`);
        await logQueue.add("logQueue", { loggerId:  i});
    }
}
init();
```
- `worker.js` : Pick up task from Queue and process it.
```js
import { Worker } from "bullmq";
import {connection} from "./connection.js"


new Worker(
    "logQueue",
    async (job) => {
      console.log(`Processing job ${job.id}: loging for Logger ID ${job.data.loggerId}`);
        return new Promise((resolve)=>{
        setTimeout(()=>{
            resolve(`resolved ${job.data.loggerId}`)
        }, 3000)
      }).then((resolvedValue)=>console.log(`INSIDE .THEN > ${resolvedValue}`));
    },
    { connection }
  );
```
